# A1 - Injection
## Bug
curs.execute() is not safe without validation.
## Fix
To avoid using direct functions, use a normal ORM method. This filters for you.

# A2 - Broken Auth
## Bug
Cookie storage is not a safe way to store session data. Pickle serializer is not good.
## Fix
Use fields = ('username', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'email', 'password') and use JSONSerializer instead of Pickle serializer.

# A3 - XSS
## Bug
The content is not HTML encoded because the safe method is referenced.
## Fix
Delete the safe method

# A4 - Insecure DOR
## Bug
Lack of auth checks
## Fix
Add in auth checks for everything the user does.
